\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgments}
First and foremost I want to thank my thesis advisor \textbf{Andreas Altorfer} for his excellent guidance during my thesis. He always had time for me even in his busiest moments and gave me full support in every possible way, for example to build up a lab with new eye and head tracking devices.  I further appreciated very much that he gave me enough room and freedom to find my own direction during the thesis project without loosing the objective. This always kept me highly motivated and productive. His advice and actions were of most importance for the success of my PhD thesis.

The same amount of acknowledgment goes to \textbf{Othmar W\"{u}rmle}. He largely supported me in all methodological aspects of my thesis, for example his ideas strongly contributed to the data quality. His profound knowledge and analytic mind strongly influenced me. Likewise, his advice was of most importance for the success of my PhD thesis.

Then, my great appreciation goes to my collaborators \textbf{Nadja Razavi} who largely contributed to the psychopathological assessments of the patients, \textbf{Ren\'{e} M\"{u}ri}, who kindly co-refereed my thesis as an international expert on eye movements and provided highly valuable comments on my work and my manuscripts, and \textbf{Christian Mikutta} for the fruitful collaboration. I want to thank \textbf{Ulrich Raub} for his important technical assistance at the beginning of my thesis, and \textbf{St\'{e}phanie Gizendanner} for her kind help with some of the figures.

My high gratitude also goes to \textbf{Andrea Federspiel}, \textbf{Thomas Dierks} and \textbf{Werner Strik} who promoted  my carrier at the end of my PhD. They entrusted me with new responsibilities in the field of neuroimaging and information technology.

I also like to thank \textbf{Rudolf Groner} and \textbf{Marina Groner} for introducing me to the field of eye movements and statistics as an undergraduate. Their passion for their fields highly motivated me as a student to go beyond a master's degree.

I would also like to thank all the members of the \textbf{Department of Psychiatric
Neurophysiology} for crating a warm and fascinating environment. I also thank the members of the \textbf{Graduate School of Health Science} for providing a diversified and high-quality PhD educational program.

Then I would like to thank \textbf{Ariane}, \textbf{Kay}, \textbf{Matthias}, \textbf{Miranka} and \textbf{Nadja}. During my time at the department they have became great friends. I would like to thank my parents \textbf{Lucia} and \textbf{Hans} and my brother \textbf{Marc} and my girlfriend \textbf{Sabrina} for all their love and encouragement.
