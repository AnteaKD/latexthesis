\chapter{Overall Discussion}
\label{chap:discussion}
The main objective of the thesis was to investigate eye-head coordination in patients with schizophrenia. In the scientific literature, consistent oculomotor deficits were found in schizophrenia, most prominently problems in antisaccade and smooth pursuit tasks. This thesis provides new evidence for abnormal eye-head coordination in schizophrenia. During every-day tasks such basic visuomotor tasks are performed a number of times, revealing problems at an already early stage of visual processing. Also the relatively simple task we used, such as recognition of symbols and colors, seem to be sufficient to find behavioral and oculomotor differences. However, it might be interesting to use more complex stimuli, for example emotional faces that can further enlarge oculomotor differences between patients and healthy controls \cite{Loughland2002a,Loughland2002}. The findings suggest that such perceptual alterations contribute to cognitive dysfunctions in schizophrenia \cite{Butler2005}. One can speculate that non-optimal visuomotor behavior can further enlarge misconceptions and abnormal thoughts when objects are not optimally attended to. 

\marginnote{\footnotesize CR reconstruction}
One of the methodological challenges in this thesis was the signal loss of the cornea reflection (CR). Usually, video-based eye tracker record both the pupil and the CR which is superior compared to pupil-only tracking in view of spatial precision. Since in eye-head coordination paradigms large saccades are performed, the signal from the  CR can disappear resulting in a complete loss of data. Therefore we developed a method to reconstruct the gaze signal from the pupil data. Upon these two signals (incomplete gaze signal and robust pupil signal), a fit is performed, and its coefficients are used to create the new reconstructed signal (see Chapter \ref{chap:schwab2012jemr}, Figure 2b). This approach not only allows to be used in eye-head coordination studies but also applies to all video-based eye tracking that suffer from CR loss. However, if target displacement is in the far eccentricity (as in our paradigm, or generally in eye-head coordination studies) then such artifacts may occur more frequently, and in this case, our approach is most notably helpful.

\marginnote{\footnotesize VOG vs. EOG}
In a comment by a reviewer, another recording method called electrooculography (EOG) has been suggested by the statement that it remains at present the best solution for eye-head coordination studies, if we reject magnetic search coil due to the level of discomfort for the subject. For example, recent studies still use EOG \cite<e.g.,>{Becker2009}. However, it is difficult to generally suggest one method as superior over the others, since all the tracking methods have their advantages and disadvantages. For example, EOG suffers from drifts and larger noise. Therefore, we provided a table with an overview of the most popular oculomotor tracking methods (see Chapter \ref{chap:schwab2012jemr}, Table 1). Nowadays, VOG is the most popular tracking method, and there recent eye-head coordination studies using VOG \cite<e.g.,>{Richard2011}. Whatever tracking method is used, it is cruel to identify the weaknesses of the system in use, and to address these problems in order to achieve satisfactory data quality. The challenge using VOG in eye-head coordination studies it clearly the CR artifacts, and this thesis provides a solution to remove such artifacts.

\marginnote{\footnotesize Tracking range}
Another issue, which is related to the previous one is the tracking range. Horizontal tracking range in VOG is typically up to $\pm$40$^\circ$ \cite{Holmqvist2011}, exact tacking ranges may differ from subject to subject. Other methods, such as scleral coil and EOG do not have  any limit concerning tracking range. However, these methods suffer from other disadvantages, for example heavy discomfort for the subjects or drift and noise in the data. In VOG, during very large saccades, the CR signal is more vulnerable that the pupil signal and can disappear when the glint is leaving the iris and merges with the sclera at large eye rotations, becoming indistinguishable, or, when the CR is covered by eyelashes or eyelids. The techniques to reconstruct CR artifacts proposed in this theses address these problems and extend the tracking range. For further experiments, to limit the amount of reconstruction and other data improving techniques during preprocessing, the targets can be positioned at an smaller eccentricity of $\pm$40$^\circ$ instead of $\pm$55$^\circ$ used in the experiments presented here.

\marginnote{\footnotesize Visual paradigm}
A visual paradigm was developed in this thesis: the peripheral visual detection task. This paradigm has been criticized in two ways. On the one hand, it was commented that the paradigm was to complex compared to simple LED diodes used in the classical studies. Presenting LEDs and ask the subject's to look at the targets may be the standard procedure and is very suitable to investigate the basics of eye-head coordination, which has been done multiple times. However, there are also studies who use more sophisticated protocols to study eye-head coordination, for example, by using different sensory modality as auditory vs. visual \cite{Goossens1997} or different instructions, for example simply look at the target vs. target identification \cite{Guyader2010}. Using such protocols, it is possible to study the effect of specific task manipulation on eye-head coordination. We created a visual recognition task to get additional behavioral measures such as response accuracy and reaction times. A recognition task is a popular standard task in psychological sciences, but has rarely been applied in eye-head coordination studies. This task requires resources in visual short term memory and attention in combination with gaze control. Such a protocol is highly suitable  to investigate in schizophrenia, which involves attentional an motor symptoms.

On the other hand, it was objected that the task was too simple with respect to the overall large number of correct responses. The tasks are not extremely cognitive challenging tasks because overall correct responses were above 90\%. However, task difficulty was nevertheless well chosen because of two reasons: first, a large number of correct responses was absolutely desired, since only correct responses were analyzed. Calculating statistics from mixed parameters of correct and incorrect responses may potentially confound the results. Increased task difficulty with only half of the trials correctly answered, involves less trials to be available for analysis. In sum, we were interested in the observation of eye-head movements patterns when the trial were answered correctly.

Second, the correct response rate revealed a drop in performance in the patient group during the Landolt task. The performance was still slightly above 90\%, but it is nevertheless a significant drop in performance revealing meaningful performance issues in the patient group in such a relatively simple task. Last but not least, concerning the response time, it is important to note that our task paradigm perfectly differentiated subjects according to task and group (e.g., controls in the color task had the shortest, patients in the Landolt task had the largest response times). This means, response time is largely dependent of both what group and what task a subject belongs to.

\marginnote{\footnotesize Collaboration}
In addition I would like to address a different project which was my main collaboration during my PhD project. This study investigated physiological changes during music perception \cite{Mikutta2013}. Twenty amateur musicians participated in the study. Their subjective arousal and objective measures such as heart rate were investigated in relation to two different interpretation of Chopin's ''Tristesse``: One version with more rhythmic tension, one with less. We found that perceived arousal strongly correlated with sound intensity (loudness). Heart rate showed only little response to changes in sound intensity. Larger changes in heart rate were caused by a version with more rhythmic tension. Therefore, we conclude that autonomous nervous activity cannot only be modulated by intensity but also by more subtitle rhythmic changes. However, correlating the time series of different signals may be challenging. The compared signals may be correlated with one another at different frequencies or time points. My contribution to this study was the applications of semblance analysis, originally developed from geosciences \cite{Cooper2008}, to the physiological data set of this study. Two signals can be analyzed as a function of both scale (or wavelength) and time. In such semblance plots, it is possible to compare the different time segments  and frequency domains of the two signals. Although this study was not related to eye-head coordination, another study investigated eye movements in violin players showing that musical performance can be investigated using this method \cite{Wurtz2009}. They found that the eye-hand span (the time between reading the score and acting) is not only influenced by expertise but also by the complexity of the score to be played.

\marginnote{\footnotesize Scientific contribution}
The main result of the present thesis is the different saccadic latencies which is modulated by the type of task presented and which could be observed in the control group but not in the patient group. Also another main result is the modeling of the response time using the eye-head coordination pattern explaining a very large amount of variance (93\%) of the data in the control group but not in the patient group indicating abnormal eye-head coordination patterns in the patient group. In an aging study, also using model building, eye-head coordination and sedative use successful predicted 1-year history of falls in elderly woman \cite{DiFabio2002}. In general, creating models from data can be very powerful since it takes multiple variables into account and evaluates each of them for its relevance. Finally, models cannot only be tested for significance but also compared to other models.

Part of this thesis replicated findings from \citeA{Kolada1983}, who observed an excess of head movements in patients with schizophrenia. However, they did not quantify saccade latencies and eye-head coordination (e.g., eye-head offsets) in the same extend. To our knowledge, the study by \citeA{Fukushima1990} is the only work who quantified eye-head coordination in patients with schizophrenia. Even though in this work 32 patients and 36 controls were involved, they examined eye-head coordination in a saccade and antisaccade task in 5 patient and 5 controls only. Therefore, we believe that our study contributes to this field in providing new findings in patients with schizophrenia \cite{SCHWAB2013PLOS}, replicating previous findings, and providing the methods to analyze eye-head coordination \cite{SCHWAB2012JEMR}. Also, this work succeeds to investigate motor and attentional symptoms in an objective and concept-free manner as requested in a recent review on motor symptoms in schizophrenia \cite{Walther2012}.
