% Intro
Oculomotor deficits are well established in schizophrenia research. For example, there is large evidence that patients with schizophrenia exhibit specific differences in eye movement behavior in view of scanpath characteristics, number of fixations, antisaccade tasks and smooth-pursuit tasks. Looking at eye movements in neurological and psychiatric diseases involves a long and productive history in oculomotor research, reflecting two primary paths of scientific investigation \cite{McDowell2011}. First, establish valid markers that could identify the risk for developing such diseases. Second, identify the underlying psychophysiological substrates of such severe psychiatric conditions. While an impressive number of research papers established and confirmed consistent abnormalities, most prominently in smooth-pursuit and antisaccade tasks, abnormalities in eye-head  coordination remain unclear. This seems surprising because eye movements are closely coupled with head movements in almost all situations in life, such as in social interactions and sports, even in reading eye movements are accompanied with minimal head movements. In real life situations, gaze shifts involve combined eye and head movements, extending the overall oculomotor range to perceive and interact with the surrounding world.

% First paper: Methods
Thus, the present thesis aimed to develop the methodology to investigate eye-head movements in order to investigate potential aberrant patterns in eye and head movements within patients with schizophrenia. As a result of this thesis, three research papers are presented here. The first paper is a methodological work discussing the capabilities and limits of the eye-head tracking system used in comparison with other technologies. This work presents a behavioral task in which color squares and Landolt rings were presented in the periphery of the visual field to invoke eye-head shifts in that direction. A method to reconstruct signal loss in video-based oculography caused by cornea reflection artifacts is introduced in order to extend the tracking range of the system. Parameters of eye-head coordination are identified using EHCA (eye-head coordination analyzer), a MATLAB software which was developed for this thesis to analyze eye-head shifts. To demonstrate the capabilities of the approach, a study with 11 healthy subjects was performed to investigate motor behavior.

% Second paper: patient study
In the second research paper, a patient study is presented, showing that patients with schizophrenia exhibit a different saccadic-latency pattern compared to controls. Patients performed more head movements, and had increased eye-head offsets during combined eye-head shifts than controls. We concluded, patients with schizophrenia may not be able to adapt to the two different tasks to the same extent as controls. This can be interpreted as a specific oculomotoric attentional dysfunction and may support the hypothesis that schizophrenia patients have difficulties determining the relevance of stimuli. Patients may also show an uneconomic over-performance of head-movements, which is possibly caused by alterations in frontal executive function that impair the inhibition of head shifts. In addition, a model was created explaining 93\% of the variance of the response times as a function of eye and head amplitude, which was only observed in the controls, indicating abnormal eye-head coordination in patients with schizophrenia. To conclude, the major contributions presented in this thesis were the development of the methodology to investigate eye-head coordination, and the patient study providing new evidence for abnormal eye-head coordination in schizophrenia. This thesis may open new perspectives, such as further research in evaluating eye-head coordination as potential marker for schizophrenia, or longitudinal studies linking eye-head coordination with psychopathology.

% Third paper
The third paper involves a collaboration beyond the topic of this thesis. I contributed software and performed the data analysis for a project that investigated physiological changes during the perception of music.
