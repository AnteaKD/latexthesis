The research presented here provided evidence of abnormal eye-head coordination in patients with schizophrenia. This can be considered as a starting point for further investigations, linking such results to psychopathology scales, investigating family members of patients to identify potential markers, or conducting longitudinal studies establish possible predictors of treatment outcome. Also, to what degree abnormal eye-head coordination relates to motor, negative or positive symptoms must be clarified.

\marginnote{\footnotesize Clinical relevance}
The examination of eye movements, sometimes also in consideration of head position and head movements are commonly applied in neurology. They are useful check possible locations of lesions \cite{Kennard2007}. For example, vestibulo-ocular monitoring can predict the outcome after severe traumatic brain injury \cite{Schlosser2009,Schlosser2005}. In the last decade, the investigation of eye movements largely contributed in the field of psychiatric disorders, not only for a precise understanding of attentional and oculomotor symptoms, but also  as potential diagnostic instrument. For example, exploratory eye movement are proposed for clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia with a sensitivity of 73\% and a specificity of 79\% \cite{Suzuki2009}. In a study by \citeA{Benson2012} 98\% of patients with schizophrenia could successfully be discriminated from controls just by eye movement behavioral data. In another study, clinical populations were classified during simply watching television \cite{Tseng2013}. However, a diagnostic instrument for schizophrenia solely based on oculography, or any other physiological measures such as neuroimaging techniques provide, may not take the whole picture for the moment, but they can provide additional information, for example towards the creation of empirical founded dimensions replacing the concept of subtypes. Instead of using subtypes (paranoid, catatonic, etc.), which have been removed in DMS-IV, the illness would rather be addressed using a defined set of dimensions along which everyone varies rather based on a category. A similar approach is used by \citeA{Strik2010} to relate symptoms to three brain systems: the motor, language and limbic system. Such diagnostic approaches provide more information and and more suitable as an instrument in research compared to subtypes. The major downside of subtypes or diagnostic categories is that it is build on a  arbitrary chosen criterion dividing abnormal and normal \cite{Peralta2007,Tsuang2000}. Also, alternative approaches such as dimensional approaches would also be in concordance with the concept of schizotypy. In this respect, the study of eye-head coordination can contribute objective, empirical-driven information for the understanding of psychopathology and the conception and validation of such dimensional scales. The study of eye-head coordination has also contributed to the understanding of other diseases, for example in movement disorders such as ataxia \cite{Panouilleres2013}, or in epilepsy \cite{McLachlan1987,Wyllie1986}.

\marginnote{\footnotesize Further potential applications}
% Robots
Beside its clinical relevance, the study of eye-head shifts can contribute to many other domains. For example in robotics, building motorized camera head, or humanoid robots capable of conducting controlled gaze shifts \cite{Law2013}.

% Sports
Another potential application is sports sciences. Visuomotor skills are a key factor in many sports. For example in baseball, hitting is a challenge for young players and requires experience over time. During hitting, within around 500 ms the batter fixates the ball and conducts a smooth pursuit eye movement to determine the trajectory of the ball and finally to perform a swing in order to hit it at the right spot. This has been studied in cricket players \cite{Land2000}: primary interest was not to establish statistical inference upon a large study sample, but to investigate individual properties of single players. Such profiles may largely contribute individualized analysis and training for specific career development. In baseball, novice players tend to move their eyes before the release of the ball by the pitcher, or fixate another sport than the release point, for example the head \cite{shank1987}.

% Combination with fMRI and TMS
Eye-movement methodology can be combined with neuroimaging: For example, eye tracking was successfully combined with fMRI and transcranial magnetic stimulation to demonstrate a connection between visual exploration by the number of fixations and the fronto-parietal cortical network, and that this connection can be altered by stimulation \cite{Chaves2012}.

% Aging
Last, eye-head coordination research can be applied in aging research to investigate elderly drivers. For example, testing visual acuity, visual field or any simple visual test without head movements may not account for the complexity of driving, where always both head and eye movement are performed \cite{Gruber2013}.
